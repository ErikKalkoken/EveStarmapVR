2. About this demo
----------------------------------------------
I am an active Eve Online player so one of my main motivations was to see the Eve galaxy in VR. As far as I know this is the first demo to provide this. Since this is my first project with Unity it was also a great opportunity to learn about the tool and scripting in C#. 

I am planning to further improve this demo in the future and would very much welcome your feedback.

4. Performance
----------------------------------------------
The demo has been build with performance in mind and is running with smooth 75Hz most of the time on the reference system. 

Please be aware though that judder will most likely occur in situation with very high amount of objects, e.g. when displaying the complete universe with all 7.500+ solar systems and 14.000+ jump connections on screen.

While generating the galaxy on startup the screen will freeze. This is normal behavior - just wait a few seconds until the galaxy is ready. This takes about 5-6 seconds on the reference system.
